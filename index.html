      <h2>Find the one or two contaminating habits to quit</h2>
      <p>
        When it comes to personal health, and especially when we find ourselves in a desperate situation, we are often told that we must do a complete overhaul of our lives to become healthier. But I believe that 90% of our health struggles actually stem from one or two (what I like to call) contaminating habits– habits which lead to other bad habits.
        This is why you find articles of people giving up beer, soda, cereal, or even social media, and they profess that it changed their life– and it does, because that one habit would set off a whole chain of reactions.
        In Japan I saw that the way I lived (ie. unhealthy person at the time) and the way the average Japanese person lived (ie. healthy person) was 90% the same– minor changes can make major impacts.

      <h2>Go on walks</h2>
      <p>
        Japanese adults walk an average of 6500 steps a day, with male adults in their 20s to 50s walking nearly 8000 steps a day on average, and women in their 20s to 50s about 7000 steps. Ogimi, Japan– a well-known Blue Zone– has a strong walking culture. Nagano, a rural prefecture in Japan, was able to reverse their high stroke rate by incorporating over 100 walking routes, and now their citizens enjoy the highest rates of longevity in the country.
        I’m not against gym culture and love a good workout, but taken too far, it can make us believe that reaching and maintaining a healthy weight is only available to the dedicated ones who consistently lift weights and are making enough time for daily runs.
